Diffusion in solids is a slow process that dictates rate-limiting processes in key chemical reactions. Unlike crystalline solids that offer well-defined diffusion pathways, the lack of similar structural motifs in amorphous or glassy materials poses great challenges in bridging the slow diffusion process and material failures. To tackle this problem, we propose an AI-guided long-term atomistic simulation approach: molecular autonomous pathfinder (MAP) framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where the RL agent is trained to uncover energy efficient diffusion pathways. We employ a Deep Q-Network architecture with distributed prioritized replay buffer, enabling fully online agent training with accelerated experience sampling by an ensemble of asynchronous agents. After training, the agents provide atomistic configurations of diffusion pathways with their energy profile. We use a piecewise nudged elastic band to refine the energy profile of the obtained pathway and the corresponding diffusion time on the basis of transition-state theory. With the MAP framework, we demonstrate atomistic diffusion mechanisms in amorphous silica with time scales comparable to experiments.
